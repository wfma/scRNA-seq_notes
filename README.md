- scRNA-seq pipeline benchmarking, beta regression to explain the variance in pipeline performance. Best settings: Genome mapping using STAR + GENCODE annotation, imputation using scone or SAVER is optional, scran or SCnorm for normalization, any differential expression method, e.g., edgeR and limma-trend, works OK. Filtering has no effect on performance. The most significant effect on performance is from normalization and library preparation choices.
